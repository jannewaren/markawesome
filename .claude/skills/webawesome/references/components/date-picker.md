Get Web Awesome Pro + Date Picker!

Date pickers display an inline calendar that lets users choose a single date or a date range. They follow the [WAI-ARIA Date Picker pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/datepicker-dialog/) and use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` for localization.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;"></wa-date-picker>
```

`<wa-date-picker>` is the inline calendar grid. It is _not_ form-associated and does not submit with forms. For an input that opens a calendar in a popover and participates in forms, use [`<wa-date-input>`](https://webawesome.com/docs/components/date-input).

## Listening for Changes

The `change` event fires when the user commits a new value. In range mode, `input` also fires after the first click of a new range, before commit.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 600px;" mode="range" months="2" class="change-listener"></wa-date-picker>
<output class="change-output"></output>

<script type="module">
  import { allDefined } from '/dist/webawesome.js';
  await allDefined();

  const picker = document.querySelector('.change-listener');
  const output = document.querySelector('.change-output');

  picker.addEventListener('change', () => {
    output.textContent = `Value: ${picker.value}`;
  });

  picker.addEventListener('wa-focus-day', event => {
    console.log('focused', event.detail.date);
  });
</script>
```

| `size` | `size` | Visual size. | `WaDatePickerSize \| 'small' \| 'medium' \| 'large'` | `'m'` |
| `locale` | `locale` | BCP-47 locale override. When empty, the inherited `lang` attribute is used. | `string` | `''` |
| `isDateDisabled` | — | Author-supplied predicate that returns `true` when a date should be disabled. Runs in addition to declarative `min` / `max` / `disabled-*` rules. JavaScript-only — set via property, not attribute. | `(date: Date) => boolean \| undefined` | — |
| `dayContent` | — | Author-supplied function that returns custom content for a day cell. Receives a `Date` and returns a string of HTML, a Lit `TemplateResult`, or `null` to use the default day number. Runs for every rendered day cell (including outside days).

## Dependencies

This component automatically imports the following elements. Sub-dependencies, if any exist, will also be included in this list.

## Examples

### Initial Value

By default, the calendar is in single-date mode. Set the `value` attribute to an ISO date string (`YYYY-MM-DD`) to preselect a date.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" value="2026-05-11"></wa-date-picker>
```

The `value` attribute always uses ISO 8601 date-only strings: `YYYY-MM-DD` for single dates and `YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD` for ranges. The JavaScript setter also accepts `Date` objects and `{ from, to }` shapes for ergonomic use in code.

```html
<script type="module">
  const picker = document.querySelector('wa-date-picker');

  // Strings
  picker.value = '2026-05-11';
  picker.value = '2026-05-11/2026-05-18';

  // Date objects (single mode)
  picker.value = new Date(2026, 4, 11);

  // Range objects
  picker.value = { from: '2026-05-11', to: '2026-05-18' };
  picker.value = { from: new Date(2026, 4, 11), to: new Date(2026, 4, 18) };
</script>
```

Read the value back with the read-only `valueAsDate` and `valueAsRange` properties for typed access.

```html
<script type="module">
  const picker = document.querySelector('wa-date-picker');

  // mode="single"
  const date = picker.valueAsDate; // Date | null

  // mode="range"
  const { from, to } = picker.valueAsRange; // { from: Date | null; to: Date | null }
</script>
```

### Min & Max

Use `min` and `max` to bound the selectable range. Days outside the bounds are disabled and not focusable.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" min="2026-05-08" max="2026-05-22" value="2026-05-15"></wa-date-picker>
```

### Disable Past & Future

Use `disable-past` or `disable-future` to disable all dates before or after today. These are convenience shortcuts that don't require knowing today's date in advance.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" disable-past></wa-date-picker>
```

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" disable-future></wa-date-picker>
```

### Date Range

Use `mode="range"` to let users pick a start and end date. In range mode, the value is two ISO dates separated by a forward slash, e.g. `2026-05-11/2026-05-18`.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 600px;" mode="range" months="2" value="2026-05-11/2026-05-18"></wa-date-picker>
```

It's a good practice to set `months="2"` in range mode so users can see both ends of the range at once.

### Two-Month Display

Set `months="2"` to render two months side-by-side. This is especially useful in range mode so users can see both ends of a long range at once.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 600px;" mode="range" months="2"></wa-date-picker>
```

By default, the previous/next buttons advance the visible range by two months. Set `page-by="single"` to advance one month at a time instead.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 600px;" months="2" page-by="single"></wa-date-picker>
```

### Sizes

Use the `size` attribute to set the calendar's size.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" size="s"></wa-date-picker>
```

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" size="m"></wa-date-picker>
```

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" size="l"></wa-date-picker>
```

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` attribute to disable the entire calendar.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" disabled value="2026-05-11"></wa-date-picker>
```

### Read Only

Use the `readonly` attribute to display the current value without allowing changes. Cells remain focusable so users can still navigate the grid with the keyboard.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" readonly value="2026-05-11"></wa-date-picker>
```

### Disabling Specific Dates

Use `disabled-dates` with a whitespace-separated list of ISO dates to disable individual days. This is useful for holidays or blackout dates. Whitespace around each date is trimmed, so you can put dates on separate lines for readability.

```html
<wa-date-picker
  style="max-width: 300px;"
  value="2026-05-11"
  disabled-dates="
    2026-05-25
    2026-05-26
    2026-07-04
  "
></wa-date-picker>
```

### Disabling Days of the Week

Use `disabled-days-of-week` to disable specific weekdays. The attribute accepts a space-separated list of three-letter weekday names (`sun`, `mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`, `fri`, `sat`), in any order.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" disabled-days-of-week="sun sat"></wa-date-picker>
```

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" disabled-days-of-week="mon wed fri"></wa-date-picker>
```

### Range Length Constraints

Use `min-range` and `max-range` to enforce a minimum or maximum range length in days. If the user's second click violates the constraint, the range is not committed.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 600px;" mode="range" months="2" min-range="3" max-range="14"></wa-date-picker>
```

### Localization

Set the `locale` attribute to a BCP-47 language tag. When omitted, the calendar uses the inherited `lang` attribute. Month and weekday names, the first day of the week, and weekend designations are all locale-aware.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" locale="es"></wa-date-picker> <br /><br />
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" locale="ko"></wa-date-picker>
```

### First Day of the Week

By default, the first day of the week is determined by the locale. Set `first-day-of-week` to a three-letter weekday name (`sun`, `mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`, `fri`, or `sat`) to override.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" first-day-of-week="mon"></wa-date-picker>
```

### Weekday Format

Use `weekday-format` to control how weekday headers are rendered.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" weekday-format="narrow"></wa-date-picker>
```

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" weekday-format="short"></wa-date-picker>
```

```html
<wa-date-picker weekday-format="long"></wa-date-picker>
```

### Week Numbers

Use `with-week-numbers` to display ISO 8601 week numbers in a column on the left.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" with-week-numbers></wa-date-picker>
```

### Outside Days

Use `with-outside-days` to render the trailing days of the previous month and the leading days of the next month inside the grid.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" with-outside-days></wa-date-picker>
```

### View Stepper

Use the `view` attribute to set the initial view. Accepted values are `days` (default), `months`, and `years`.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" view="months"></wa-date-picker>
```

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" view="years"></wa-date-picker>
```

### Conditionally Disabling Dates

For complex rules (e.g. holidays loaded from an API, weekday + odd-week conditions), set the `isDateDisabled` JavaScript property to a function that receives a `Date` and returns `true` to disable it. This runs in addition to the declarative `disabled-*` attributes — a date is disabled if _any_ rule matches it.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" class="custom-disabled"></wa-date-picker>

<script type="module">
  import { allDefined } from '/dist/webawesome.js';
  await allDefined();

  const picker = document.querySelector('.custom-disabled');
  // Disable every other Monday
  picker.isDateDisabled = date => {
    if (date.getDay() !== 1) return false;
    const week = Math.floor(date.getDate() / 7);
    return week % 2 === 0;
  };
</script>
```

### Custom Day Content

To render custom content inside a specific day cell, provide a slot named `day-YYYY-MM-DD`. The slotted content replaces the day's label but the button chrome (data attributes, ARIA, click handling) is preserved. This is useful for badges, dots, or holiday labels.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" value="2026-12-25">
  <span slot="day-2026-01-01">🎆</span>
  <span slot="day-2026-02-14">❤️</span>
  <span slot="day-2026-03-17">🍀</span>
  <span slot="day-2026-04-22">🌍</span>
  <span slot="day-2026-10-31">🎃</span>
  <span slot="day-2026-12-25">🎄</span>
</wa-date-picker>
```

### Dynamic Day Content

For content that follows a rule across many dates (e.g. paydays, recurring events, moving holidays), set the `dayContent` JavaScript property to a function that receives a `Date` and returns a string of HTML, a Lit `TemplateResult`, or `null` to use the default label. This runs for every rendered day cell, so it scales to any year the user navigates to.

If both a `day-YYYY-MM-DD` slot and `dayContent` apply to the same date, the slot wins.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" class="dynamic-days"></wa-date-picker>

<script type="module">
  import { allDefined } from '/dist/webawesome.js';
  await allDefined();

  const picker = document.querySelector('.dynamic-days');
  picker.dayContent = date => {
    const day = date.getDate();
    const lastDay = new Date(date.getFullYear(), date.getMonth() + 1, 0).getDate();
    let i = 1;
    if (day === 15 || day === lastDay)
      return `
      <wa-tooltip for="brian-${i}">I thought you'd never ask</wa-tooltip>
      <span id="brian-${i}">💰</span>
    `;
    i++;
    return null;
  };
</script>
```

### Custom Footer

Add buttons or other content below the calendar using the `footer` slot. The picker exposes `goToToday()` and `clear()` methods for common shortcut buttons.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;" class="footer-example">
  <div slot="footer">
    <wa-button class="today-btn" size="s" appearance="outlined">Today</wa-button>
    <wa-button class="clear-btn" size="s" appearance="outlined">Clear</wa-button>
  </div>
</wa-date-picker>

<script type="module">
  import { allDefined } from '/dist/webawesome.js';
  await allDefined();

  const picker = document.querySelector('.footer-example');
  picker.querySelector('.today-btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
    picker.value = new Date();
    picker.goToToday();
  });
  picker.querySelector('.clear-btn').addEventListener('click', () => picker.clear());
</script>
```

### Custom Navigation Icons

Replace the default chevrons by slotting your own icons into `previous-icon` and `next-icon`.

```html
<wa-date-picker style="max-width: 300px;">
  <wa-icon slot="previous-icon" name="caret-left" variant="solid"></wa-icon>
  <wa-icon slot="next-icon" name="caret-right" variant="solid"></wa-icon>
</wa-date-picker>
```
