## Examples

### Adding Video Sources

The simplest way to add a video is with the `src` attribute.

```html
<wa-video
  src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/01-create-your-first-kit.mp4"
  title="Using Kits in Your Project"
  poster="/assets/images/fa-part-1.jpg"
></wa-video>
```

For multiple formats or additional options, use [`<source>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/source) elements instead.

```html
<wa-video title="Using Kits in Your Project" poster="/assets/images/fa-part-1.jpg">
  <source src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/01-create-your-first-kit.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/01-create-your-first-kit.ogv" type="video/ogg" />
  <source src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/01-create-your-first-kit.webm" type="video/webm" />
</wa-video>
```

### Controls

The video player offers three control presets: `none`, `standard`, and `full`.

#### None

No controls are displayed. The video can still be played programmatically via JavaScript, and the poster overlay and captions remain visible.

```html
<wa-video controls="none" title="My Video" poster="/assets/images/kits.jpg">
  <source
    src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/Doing%20More%20with%20FA%20Ep.%203%20'Downloading%20Kits'.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</wa-video>
```

#### Standard

Displays playback, a seekable timeline, elapsed/total time, volume, captions, and fullscreen controls.

```html
<wa-video controls="standard" title="My Video" poster="/assets/images/fa-part-2.jpg">
  <source src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/02-using-kits-in-your-project.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <track
    src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/02-using-kits-in-your-project.vtt"
    kind="subtitles"
    srclang="en"
    label="English"
  />
</wa-video>
```

#### Full

Includes everything in standard, plus playback speed selection and picture-in-picture.

```html
<wa-video controls="full" title="My Video" poster="/assets/images/fa-part-1.jpg">
  <source src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/01-create-your-first-kit.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <track
    src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/01-create-your-first-kit.vtt"
    kind="subtitles"
    srclang="en"
    label="English"
  />
</wa-video>
```

### Poster Images

Add a poster image that displays before the video plays. If no `poster` is provided, no overlay is shown and the browser will display the first frame of the video instead.

```html
<wa-video title="Using Kits in Your Project" poster="/assets/images/teams.jpg" controls="full">
  <source
    src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/Doing%20More%20with%20FA%20Ep.%202%20'Using%20Teams'.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</wa-video>
```

### Captions & Subtitles

Add a [`<track>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/track) element to enable captions using [standard WebVTT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API/Web_Video_Text_Tracks_Format) files.

```html
<wa-video controls="standard" title="Using Kits in Your Project" poster="/assets/images/fa-part-1.jpg">
  <source src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/01-create-your-first-kit.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <track
    src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/01-create-your-first-kit.vtt"
    kind="subtitles"
    srclang="en"
    label="English"
  />
</wa-video>
```

Captions are rendered above the video controls and automatically adjust position when controls show or hide.

### Icon Slots

Several slots like `poster-icon` and `pause-icon` are provided to let you customize which icons you'd like to show.

```html
<wa-video title="Using Kits in Your Project" poster="/assets/images/teams.jpg" controls="full">
  <wa-icon slot="poster-icon" name="kiwi-bird" family="duotone" variant="solid"></wa-icon>
  <wa-icon slot="play-icon" name="fish" family="duotone" variant="solid"></wa-icon>
  <wa-icon slot="pause-icon" name="fish-bones" family="duotone" variant="solid"></wa-icon>
  <source
    src="https://uploads.webawesome.com/Doing%20More%20with%20FA%20Ep.%202%20'Using%20Teams'.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</wa-video>
```

To group multiple videos into a playlist, use [`<wa-video-playlist>`](https://webawesome.com/docs/components/video-playlist).
